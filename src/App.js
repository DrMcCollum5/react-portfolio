          I've made the transition from health education to become a freelance
          web developer. I've created several full stack web apps with
          JavaScript/HTML5/CSS. I work primarily with React/Node.js, but I'm
          always looking for opportunities to work with new technologies. I love
          the complex problem solving involved in creating good code, and I'm
          passionate about delivering a good user experience, from optimizing
          query times for fast data delivery on the back end to creating
          intuitive, responsive UI on the front end. Technical Skills: Front End
          Technologies: JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Redux, HTML5, CSS, Styled
          Components, Back End Technologies: Node.js, Database: MySQL, NoSQL,
          MongoDB.

          My specialties include a multitude of approaches and platforms to
          solve programming tasks. I bring a unique and innovated style when
          developing existing projects. Thriving in a fast-paced environment
          where there are frequent challenges is what motivates me as a
          developer. I am also eager to seize new opportunities and
          responsibilities. I work well independently and in collaboration with
          others.
